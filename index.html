      <h2> A little about me... </h2>
      <p> I have worked in operations, sales,  leadership and recruiting for my whole working life in industries like healthcare, fitness and hospitality industries. 
        While working face to face with consumers was exciting; I found that I was really inspired by creating somethiing engaging and usefull with my own hands! 
        I've always been really keen to learn new langauges when I was in school, and I love working that side of my brain. Naturally, when I began learning to code, 
        the combination of using that language center and making something from scratch ignited my passion! </p>
      <p> Outside of school and work here are a few things I enjoy: 
        <ul>
          <li> Reading </li>
          <li> Playing with my dogs, Plum and trixie! </li>
          <li> Spreadsheets!! </li>
      </ul>
